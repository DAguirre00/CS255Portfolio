# CS255Portfolio
Here is my portfilo submission for CS255

The DriverPass project was to take an idea for an application and design a system around it based on what the owner wanted. The client Liam wanted to create an application that would help with schedueling training for new drivers since he notices a lot of drivers fail on there first attemt at there drivers test. So he asks that you design a system that allows the student to schedual practice tests with a driver in order to help the students learn better. Parts of the application include teacher feedback and the ability to rescheduel an appointment. 
I think in these project what I did well was understanding what the customer wanted and where the application would go once coding started. Alomg with that I feel I did a decent job with the charts.
If I had to choose one part to revise, I would probably clean up the charts I did make, although they seem fine I feel they are a bit cluttered and could be more clear and straight forward.
I think when it came to the users needs I was able to include the different parts of the system into things like the UML diagram so they could see how the different parts of the system work together.
I think what I try and do the most is make sure all the requitments are met and start from the most basic part of the system and build outwards. In the case of this system I would start with the user login system and work towards all the other aspects of it until the system is complete.
